We are looking for a motivated PhD candidate to work on the project
**FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF VERTEBRATES AND HUMAN USES: LINKS BETWEEN
FUNCTIONAL TRAITS, HUMAN USES AND BIODIVERSITY CRISIS**

If you are interested, contact us <a href="mailto:aurele.toussaint@cnrs.fr">here</a>

### Where ?

**Centre for Research in Biodiversity and Environment (CRBE)**, University
of Toulouse, France.

### With who ?

She/he will be supervised by myself and Pr. <a href="http://brosse.sebastien.free.fr/" target="_blank">**SÃ©bastien Brosse**</a> from
University of Toulouse 3 - Paul Sabatier.

## Financial support

The PhD candidate will apply for a PhD fellowship from the doctoral
school
<a href="https://ed-sevab.univ-toulouse.fr/as/ed/edsevab/entree.pl" target="_blank">SEVAB</a>.
If succeed, the PhD candidate will be funded for a period of 3 years.

## Profile of the candidate

We are looking for a candidate with a Master's degree in ecology,
evolutionary biology, or related fields. The candidate should have a
strong background in functional ecology, community ecology, and/or
macroecology. The candidate should have experience in statistical
analyses and programming (R, Python). The candidate should have good
communication skills and be fluent in French (optional) and English.

## Project description

Understanding the ecological role of species within their ecosystems is
a central pillar of functional ecology. In particular, this discipline
relies on the analysis of functional traits - morphological,
physiological or phenological attributes that can be measured at the
individual level - to assess the responses of organisms to their
environment and their contributions to ecosystem processes (Violle et
al. 2007). Analysis of global trait databases has shown that certain
ecological strategies are shared by many species, reflecting
evolutionary and ecological constraints, while few species possess
unique combinations of traits (Carmona et al. 2021; Toussaint et al.
2021). These analyses have also revealed that species with particular
values of traits, such as large body size, late reproduction and/or low
fecundity rate, are at higher risk of extinction. Around 15,000
vertebrate species are exploited by humans across the world for a
variety of purposes, including food, domestication and activities such
as hunting and sport fishing (Darimont et al. 2023). These human
interactions not only highlight the importance of the ecosystem services
provided by these species, but also exacerbate the anthropogenic
pressures to which they are subject, with almost 40% of them threatened
with extinction (Darimont et al. 2023; IUCN 2020). Conversely, human
uses can also favour the species concerned, which can then become
invasive (Li et al. 2023). Determining the functional role of these
species of interest to humans and their potential impact on native
communities (e.g. Toussaint et al. 2024) is crucial to tackle the
current decline in biodiversity. Despite the recognition of these
issues, there is still a lack of studies exploring the diversity of
functional traits of vertebrate species used by humans; a gap that
limits our understanding of human preferences for particular ecological
strategies. In the current context of global change, understanding the
functional role of these species is essential to guide conservation
strategies, which must take account not only of the role of species in
ecosystems but also of their societal importance, in order to promote
sustainable coexistence between biodiversity and human societies.
